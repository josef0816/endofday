# Scenario 1 — The Swarm / $100,000 Strategy Narrative

## Panel 1 — The Standoff  
Two ships hold a perfect faceoff above the megacity. The Legacy warship looms heavy and industrial — red, overbuilt, imposing. The Agentic ship sits razor-clean and silver-blue, calm and surgical. Same $100,000. Two philosophies of scale locked on a single axis.

## Panel 2 — The Legacy Commander  
In amber-lit steel and shadow, the Legacy Commander fills the frame — battle-hardened, confident, unflinching. He trusts mass and complexity the way older empires trust concrete. His face says the same thing his ship does: we win by building heavier.

## Panel 3 — The Decision  
Over his shoulder, the cockpit glows crimson as he commits the budget. The tactical display reads:  
**BUDGET: $100,000**  
**ACTION: DEPLOY SOLDIER**  
**STATUS: INITIALIZING**  
The machine vibrates and groans, like it needs time just to begin obeying.

## Panel 4 — The Long Wait  
The two ships hover nose-to-nose. The Legacy ship glows red from within. The Agentic ship remains sleek and silent. Equal capital. The tension line is perfect. This is philosophy versus philosophy.

## Panel 5 — The Anxious Viewport  
Through the circular porthole, his face is closer and more human. He’s not raging — he’s waiting. The glow flickers across sweat and fatigue. The cost here is time.

## Panel 6 — Release From the Legacy Hull  
From beneath the heavy ship, a single pod drops into open air. Metal plates split and vent heat. This is linear deployment: one unit, one path, one outcome.

## Panel 7 — Linear Descent  
The pod falls between skyscrapers like a burning bullet. Sparks trail downward. Dramatic — but singular. The entire strategy compressed into one falling point.

## Panel 8 — Impact and Exit  
The pod slams into the street and opens into firelight. A lone soldier steps out into smoke and glowing debris. It looks heroic — until you realize it’s one body against an entire grid.

## Panel 9 — Budget Collapse  
Back inside the cockpit, the scoreboard is brutal: **$0** above the Legacy ship. The full $100,000 spent to move the map by inches. The result is visible, but tiny.

## Panel 10 — The Agentic Commander  
Cut to cool blue lighting. The Agentic Commander sits composed and controlled. His environment feels frictionless — not mechanical strain, but execution waiting for a command.

## Panel 11 — Instant Execution  
He touches the interface with a fingertip. No force. No drama. The gesture is minimal — because in this world, scale doesn’t require strain. It requires system design.

## Panel 12 — The Release  
A sleek capsule drops from the Agentic ship into cold twilight. No sparks. No grind. It doesn’t fall — it commits, guided by precision.

## Panel 13 — Vector Bloom  
Mid-air, the capsule separates along clean seams and multiplies into many smaller units. Geometry unfolds calmly. Scale was encoded from the beginning.

## Panel 14 — Swarm Touchdown  
Hundreds of humanoid droids land in synchronized formation across wet streets. Reflections and mist amplify their cold blue highlights. This isn’t chaos — it’s coordination.

## Panel 15 — System Error  
The Legacy Commander watches red percentages give way to blue: **68% → 82% → 91%**. His certainty fractures. This isn’t a firefight. It’s a structural defeat.

## Panel 16 — Still $100,000  
Through the cockpit glass, the Agentic ship remains untouched. Above it: **$100,000 — intact**. Scale without depletion.

## Panel 17 — The Ender  
A wide cinematic takeover. The city grid floods electric blue like circuitry activating across infrastructure. The doctrine lands:  

**“Don’t hire soldiers. Deploy a swarm.”**  

The final feeling isn’t victory. It’s inevitability.

# Scenario 2 — Overtime / Blue Server Narrative

## Panel 1 — The Reflection  
An extreme close-up of Dave’s eye. Electric blue light pulses across his iris, data flickering in miniature across the surface. For a split second, it looks almost alive. He sits commanding something massive. Then the truth settles in. The glow is just a monitor. The battlefield is just work.

## Panel 2 — 9:00 PM  
Pull back. Dave is alone in a dark office. Rain streaks the windows behind him. The city outside is alive, but distant. His shirt is rolled up. The timestamp on the screen reads 9:00 PM. The only sound is typing and the faint hum of machinery. This is overtime.

## Panel 3 — The Presence  
In the corner of the room, a sleek server tower emits a soft electric-blue glow. It’s subtle, steady, patient. The same blue reflected in his eye. It doesn’t intrude. It simply waits.

## Panel 4 — The Accusation  
He stands slowly and walks toward it. The room feels smaller with each step. Weeks of late nights compress into one sharp sentence: “You’re taking my job.”  
The server does not respond. It just hums.

## Panel 5 — The Sabotage  
Close-up on his hand gripping the power cable. Blue light splits across his knuckles. The hum vibrates faintly through the floor. His jaw tightens. This is the breaking point — man reclaiming control. He begins to pull.

## Panel 6 — The Intervention  
Before the plug disconnects, his monitor behind him flares brighter. The blue light intensifies across the room.

## Panel 7 — The Realization  
Dave freezes. He turns back toward his desk. The inbox counter reads zero. The dashboard is complete. Every pending task — finished. He refreshes the screen. Still zero. The overtime that owned his night is gone.

## Panel 8 — The Relief  
Back at his desk, Dave sits down slowly. The blue light is no longer harsh. It blends with the cool city glow behind him. His shoulders relax. The tightness in his jaw fades. A small, almost disbelieving smile forms — not triumphant, not arrogant — just grateful.  
He wasn’t replaced.  
He was released.  
For the first time in weeks, he’s ahead of the clock.

## Panel 9 — The Exit  
Exterior. The lobby doors open and Dave steps out into the rain-slick night. The city reflects in glass and pavement. He adjusts his jacket, breath visible in the cool air. Above him, one floor still glows electric blue — steady, tireless. He doesn’t look back.

## Panel 10 — The Reunion  
From Dave’s perspective, we see her first. She stands beneath a dark umbrella, city lights shimmering behind her in soft blue and gold. Rain falls steadily, but she’s smiling — not surprised, not dramatic — just happy to see him earlier than expected.  
He approaches slowly, shoulder bag hanging loose, tie undone. There’s no urgency in his step anymore. The night feels open. For the first time in a long time, he’s home before the rain stops.

## Panel 11 — The Walk  
They walk side by side down the rain-soaked street, sharing the umbrella. Reflections ripple across the pavement — white headlights, warm storefronts, distant office towers fading into the night.  
He isn’t checking his phone.  
He isn’t distracted.  
They talk. They laugh quietly. The city continues behind them, but it no longer owns him.  

**“We don’t steal your job. We steal your overtime.”**
